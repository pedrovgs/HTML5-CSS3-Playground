HTML5 & CSS3 Playground created just for learning purposes :smiley:

# Playing in this playground

As this repository is thought to just learn something about HTML5 & CSS3 we've configured [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and added some nice development dependencies to be able to make our life easier when writing some code. **If you want to just start a HTTP server showing the content of this page in your default browser you just need to execute:**

```
yarn start # You can navigate using the src folder as the root path.
yarn startBlogPostExample # Users "blog post playground" as index;
yarn startOmnifood # Uses "omnifood playground" as index.
```

This command will create a simple HTTP server using the ``src`` folder as the root path. Under the hood this command is using **[live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) to refresh your browser everytime you change part of the HTML or CSS code** so you don't have to press CMD+R after every change :smiley:

## Style lint

As this repository contains just HTML5 and CSS3 code we decided to add a powerful linter named [Stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint) you can easily run by executing the following commands:

```
yarn lintCSS # Checks if the CSS code contains any lint error.
yarn lintHTML # Checks if the HTML code contains any lint error.
yarn lint # Checks if the CSS or the HTML code contains any lint error.
```

The linter configuration can be found in the file named ``.stylelintrc``. It's simple extension of the [stylelint-config-standard](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard) configuration.

You can automatically fix your CSS errors by executing ``yarn fixCSS``, your HTML errors using the command ``yarn fixHTML`` or fix them all by just executing ``yarn fixLint``.
